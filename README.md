## Learning Russian Vocabulary

Production deployment: https://learning-russian-vocabulary-fe.onrender.com   

Russian learners can subscribe to daily vocabulary words to build their vocabulary. The vocabulary can be categorized by different levels. To subscribe, just visit the final website, where users can sign up and sign in, preview sample words for each level, and see past daily words. This service can help build Russian learners' vocabulary but won't cover grammar or other language fundamentals. It can serve as a resource to supplement a Russian course or study plan. Thus, the pages must be user-friendly. The users can clearly see different Russian words on the website.

We developed a web app to help people learn Russian vocabulary through daily emails containing words and example sentences. Users can sign up, select their level, review past words, and take quizzes. We use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and Tailwind CSS.
